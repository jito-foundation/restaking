Jito (Re)staking is a multi-asset staking protocol for node consensus networks. The protocol tokenizes staked assets as
vault receipt tokens for enhanced liquidity and composability. Node consensus networks can use Jito Restaking to easily
customize staking parameters, slashing conditions, and economic incentives to tailor their security and tokenomics.
