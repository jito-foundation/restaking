## 1. About the program

The restaking program acts as a registry for NCNs, operators, and relationships between NCNs, operators, and vaults.

It allows users to do the following:

- Registers NCN, operators, and their configurations.
- Stores relationships between NCN, operators, and vaults.

The restaking program does not store any funds; it is purely used as a registry and relationship manager between
entities in the system.

## 2. Ncn

NCN (Node Consensus Network) are services that provide infrastructure to the network, such as validators, oracles, keepers, bridges, L2s, and
other services that require a staking mechanism for security.

NCN can be registered through the restaking program.

There are several things one can do after registering an NCN:

- Add and remove support for operators participating in the NCN operator set.
- Add and remove support for vaults
- Add and remove support for slashers
- Withdraw funds sent to the NCN from rewards, airdrops, and other sources.

## 3. Operator

Operators are entities responsible for running NCN software.

Operators can register through the restaking program and configure several variables:

- Add and remove support for vaults
- Add and remove support for NCN
- Change voter keys
- Withdraw funds sent to the operator from rewards, airdrops, and other sources.

## 4.1. NcnOperatorState

This state represents the mutual opt-in relationship between an NCN and an Operator. The NCN initializes this state. Once created, the NCN and operator can both warm-up and cooldown the state to show support for each other.

    Operator -.->|Opts in| NCN
    Operator -->|Updates| NcnOperatorState
```

## 4.2. NcnVaultTicket

This ticket represents the relationship between an NCN and a Vault. It is created by the NCN to opt in to work with a Vault.

```mermaid
graph TD
    classDef main fill: #f9f, stroke: #333, stroke-width: 2px;
    classDef ticket fill: #fff, stroke: #333, stroke-width: 1px;

    Vault[Vault]:::main
    NcnVaultTicket[NcnVaultTicket]:::ticket
    NCN -->|Creates| NcnVaultTicket
    NCN -.->|Opts in| Vault
```

## 4.3. OperatorVaultTicket

This ticket represents the relationship between an Operator and a Vault. It is created by the Operator to opt in to work with a Vault.

```mermaid
graph TD
    classDef main fill: #f9f, stroke: #333, stroke-width: 2px;
    classDef ticket fill: #fff, stroke: #333, stroke-width: 1px;

    Vault[Vault]:::main
    OperatorVaultTicket[OperatorVaultTicket]:::ticket
    Operator -->|Creates| OperatorVaultTicket
    Operator -.->|Opts in| Vault
```

## 4.4. NcnVaultSlasherTicket

This ticket represents the slashing relationship between an NCN and a Vault. The NCN register slashers, which allows the slasher to potentially slash the Vault under appropriate conditions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    classDef main fill: #f9f, stroke: #333, stroke-width: 2px;
    classDef ticket fill: #fff, stroke: #333, stroke-width: 1px;

    Vault[Vault]:::main
    NcnVaultSlasherTicket[NcnVaultSlasherTicket]:::ticket
    Ncn -->|Creates| NcnVaultSlasherTicket
    Ncn -.->|Opts in| Vault
```
