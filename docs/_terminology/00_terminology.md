- **Node Operator (or Operator)**: A specialized party who runs core functionalities for NCNs, such as performing specific offchain computations and participating in consensus 
- **Node Consensus Network (NCN)**: A set of node operators running software for the same network, working together to achieve consensus and provide services.
- **Vault**: A smart contract that securely holds staked assets and delegates them to operators.
- **Vault Receipt Token (VRT)**: A tokenized representation of staked assets inside a vault, allowing for liquidity and
  composability.
- **Staking**: The process of collateraliziung assets to support network operations and earn rewards.
- **(Re)staking**: The process of staking already-staked assets, such as liquid staking tokens. E.g. Whereas users can “stake” SOL to NCNs, users can “(re)stake” JitoSOL to NCNs.
- **Slashing**: A penalty mechanism where a portion of staked assets and/or expected rewards are forfeited if an operator misbehaves or fails to meet performance requirements.
- **Delegation**: The act of assigning staked assets to specific operators within the network.
- **Multi-Asset Staking**: The ability to stake various types of SPL tokens, not limited to native blockchain tokens.
- **Liquid Staking**: A form of staking that provides liquidity to Solana stakers.
- **SPL Token**: Solana Program Library Token, a standard for creating and managing tokens on the Solana blockchain.
- **Epoch**: A fixed period in the blockchain during which staking rewards are calculated and distributed.
